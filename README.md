# fly-io-distributed-challenge
My attempt at the fly.io distributed challenge

1. Fairly straightforward, didn't include in the repo
2. Fairly straightforward, got away with uuids
3a. Simple broadcast
3b. Just naively send messages to everyone
3c. Send messages but do them with retries
3d. I need to rethink my broadcast implementation and probably create an intelligent topology.
